exp2: 1% packet loss (ignored an older folder)
exp3: 2% packet loss
exp4: 1% packet duplicate 
exp5: 5% packet duplicate
exp6: 25% 50% reordering
exp7: 25% 50% reordering
exp8 folder to the same location, which has 3% packet loss. 5% packet loss gives me pretty low throughput <20 Mbps, I hope 3% loss is fine.
